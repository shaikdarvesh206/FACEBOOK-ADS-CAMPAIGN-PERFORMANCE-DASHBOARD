## 💡 Step 4: Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🔍 *Insights*
- Campaign *1178* contributes ~85% of total spend but shows declining CTR.  
- CTR (%) trend gradually decreases over time, indicating ad fatigue.  
- *Female audiences* show slightly higher CTR than males across all age groups.  
- Highest ROI observed for campaigns with moderate spend and balanced conversion rates.

### 💬 *Recommendations*
- Refresh ad creatives for high-spend campaigns to avoid audience fatigue.  
- Reallocate budget to better-performing age & gender segments.  
- Experiment with A/B testing on lower CTR campaigns.  
- Prioritize audience segments (35–49 years) showing consistent engagement.
